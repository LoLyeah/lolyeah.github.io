    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured into four main, non-linear sections accessible via a top navigation bar: 'Home' (an introduction to the core biological concepts), 'Dietary Deep Dive' (an interactive card-based explorer for specific interventions), 'Evidence Explorer' (a visual dashboard with a chart comparing intervention effectiveness and an interactive Fact/Myth table), and 'Practical Guide' (a tiered action plan). This thematic structure was chosen over a linear report format to empower users to directly access the information most relevant to them, promoting exploration and comparison rather than passive reading. The user flow is designed to move from understanding the 'why' (Home), to exploring the 'what' (Deep Dive), to analyzing the 'how effective' (Evidence Explorer), and finally to applying the 'how-to' (Practical Guide), creating a more intuitive and useful learning journey. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Effect sizes of various diets. -> Goal: Compare. -> Viz/Method: Interactive horizontal bar chart (Chart.js). -> Interaction: Tooltips on hover provide exact values and context. -> Justification: A bar chart provides the clearest, most immediate visual comparison of the magnitude of different interventions' effects, which is a central theme of the report.
        - Report Info: Details on each dietary intervention (FFD, AFCs, PUFAs, etc.). -> Goal: Inform/Organize. -> Viz/Method: Interactive HTML/CSS cards. -> Interaction: Clicking a card reveals a detailed summary. -> Justification: Cards break down dense information into manageable chunks, preventing user overload and allowing self-directed exploration of specific topics.
        - Report Info: Fact or Myth table. -> Goal: Inform/Organize. -> Viz/Method: Interactive HTML table. -> Interaction: A search/filter input to quickly find claims. -> Justification: An interactive table is more engaging and far more usable than a static one, allowing users to quickly verify specific beliefs.
        - Report Info: Biological mechanisms. -> Goal: Inform. -> Viz/Method: Three-column layout with icons (HTML/CSS/Unicode). -> Interaction: Static display. -> Justification: Simplifies complex scientific concepts into visually distinct, easily digestible themes (Neurotransmitters, Gut-Brain, Inflammation).
        - Report Info: Tiered clinical application framework. -> Goal: Organize/Inform. -> Viz/Method: Styled HTML/CSS sections. -> Interaction: Static display. -> Justification: A clear, step-by-step visual layout makes the practical recommendations actionable and easy to follow.

Moving beyond simplistic claims, we'll examine how dietary patterns and specific nutrients can influence brain health through key biological pathways.

            title: 'Whole-Diet Approach (e.g., Mediterranean)',
            verdict: 'Strongest correlational evidence',
            summary: 'This approach focuses on overall dietary patterns. "Healthy" patterns are consistently linked to a lower risk of ADHD, while "Unhealthy/Western" patterns are linked to a higher risk.',
            details: 'This is the most recommended, lowest-risk, and biologically sound approach. It emphasizes whole foods, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats, which support brain health through multiple pathways simultaneously.'

        { claim: "Sugar is a direct cause of ADHD and hyperactivity.", verdict: "MYTH", explanation: "High-quality RCTs show no direct causal link. The perceived effect is often due to the exciting environments where sugar is consumed. However, diets high in sugar are part of an 'unhealthy' pattern linked to increased ADHD risk." },
        { claim: "Eliminating artificial food colors (AFCs) can benefit some children with ADHD.", verdict: "FACT", explanation: "Meta-analyses show a small but significant effect for a sensitive subgroup (est. 8% of children with ADHD). It is considered a low-risk trial." },
        { claim: "Omega-3 (fish oil) supplements are an effective treatment for ADHD.", verdict: "MYTH", explanation: "The highest-certainty evidence from the most recent Cochrane Review concludes that omega-3 supplementation has no significant effect on core ADHD symptoms compared to placebo." },
        { claim: "A highly restrictive 'Few-Foods Diet' (FFD) can lead to dramatic improvement in a subgroup of children.", verdict: "FACT", explanation: "The FFD shows the largest effect size of any dietary intervention in some studies. It is highly effective for a 'food-sensitive' subtype but is extremely difficult and requires professional supervision." },
        { claim: "A gluten-free diet is a proven treatment for ADHD.", verdict: "MYTH", explanation: "There is no high-quality evidence to support a gluten-free diet for ADHD, unless the individual has a diagnosed celiac disease or a demonstrated non-celiac gluten sensitivity." },
        { claim: "A 'Western' or 'Junk Food' diet is associated with a higher risk of ADHD.", verdict: "FACT", explanation: "Multiple large-scale meta-analyses show a strong and consistent correlation. Diets high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats are linked to a significantly increased likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis." },
        { claim: "A 'Healthy' diet (like the Mediterranean diet) is associated with a lower risk of ADHD.", verdict: "FACT", explanation: "Meta-analyses show that diets rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and fish are associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis. This is the most consistently supported, lowest-risk approach." },
        { claim: "Mega-doses of vitamins are a safe and effective therapy for ADHD.", verdict: "MYTH", explanation: "There is no evidence to support mega-dosing vitamins. This practice is not effective and can be toxic. Supplementation is only warranted for a confirmed deficiency under medical supervision." },
        { claim: "Children with ADHD may be more likely to have low levels of certain nutrients, like iron and zinc.", verdict: "FACT", explanation: "Observational studies show an association between ADHD and lower levels of iron (ferritin) and, less consistently, zinc. It's unclear if this is a cause or a consequence of ADHD-related eating habits." },
        { claim: "Diet can replace standard medical treatments like medication and therapy.", verdict: "MYTH", explanation: "No dietary intervention has been shown to be a replacement for evidence-based first-line treatments. Diet should be considered a foundational and complementary approach, not a standalone cure." }
